# Breast-Cancer-Analysis
 In todayâ€™s world health is the biggest issue as people are more effecting due to  the food they eat and the environment in which they live. 
Doctors are not able to judge the cancer before the time period as doctors are not aware of the symptoms the patient carry which leads them to the cancer. 
Doctors are able to predict cancer of mostly last stage because of less information availability. 
So, machine learning model helps the doctor to predict at the early stage of the cancer by taking all the necessary points into consideration. 

Machine Learning models are fast and flexible to predict the cancer in the patient. 
As model are not replacing the doctors but give the more flexibility to analyze the data given of the patient. 
As predicting cancer is classification problem so we applied various classification models to predict. 

As all the models are not predicting well on the dataset where KNN comes out of picture and perform well on the dataset 
as KNN is the *distance* measure model so features of  benign and malign cancer are less distance. 

Hence KNN performing best in all of other models. 

Using PCA which help to remove the redundancy given to the standalone model and it will improve the accuracy by removing the redundancy.
In the end use the k fold technique to work on the full data and provide the measure of Spread  or variance of the data to the model and 
then it will perform best on the test data or unseen data.
